# Project Title 
Project Euler: The First 100 Problems

# Project Description 
Project Euler is a series of difficult mathematical / computer programming problems aimed at those looking to challenge their problem-solving skills (read more about it [here](https://projecteuler.net/)).

The goal of this project is relatively simple: to create efficient and elegant solutions to Project Euler’s first 100 problems in C.  As a lover of both mathematics and of programming, I wanted to translate complex mathematical theory into clean, high performance code.

C was chosen for two main reasons:
1. Efficiency and speed
2. To explore foundational programming and algorithms without heavy reliance on existing libraries.  In other words, to demonstrate the “purest” possible algorithmic solutions to these problems.

# How to Explore this Repository
I've solved each problem in the corresponding file in this repository. For example, problem012.c corresponds to the problem with ID 12 on [this page](https://projecteuler.net/archives) of the Project Euler website.

# Technologies Used
C
